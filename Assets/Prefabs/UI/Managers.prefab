    - 'Female Voice: Well, hello there, It seems that you were hand selected to become
      our newest Peer Academic Leader, or as I like to call them, Pal. In order to
      be accepted as our new Pal, we will put your chemistry knowledge to the test.
      And I thought, what better way to test your knowledge and quick thinking skills
      than an escape room!'
    - "Male Voice: Alright alright I think that's enough. Let\u2019s get to the basics,
      you\u2019ll need to escape two rooms within 30 minutes in order to pass. Ha!
      Really, 30 minutes? I escaped in 10 minutes, but I digress.  This is a fairly
      simple task I assure you."
    - "Female Voice: Ahem, before we begin, you might not be too familiar with how
      things work around here.\r"
    - 'Male Voice: No really, I thought they were geniuses who were experts in chemistry.'
    - "Female Voice: Anyway, Allow me to help you. Use your left joystick to move
      around, you\u2019ll be doing that a lot around here. Tilt your head to look
      around your surroundings, try not to trip on anything."
    - 'Male Voice: Hehehe good luck with that.'
    - 'Female Voice: Your right joystick lets you look around too, not as reliable
      as moving that head of yours yea?


      Use either the left or right triggers
      on your controllers to grab or let go of anything within the lab rooms. Try
      grabbing that ball and just throwing it.

'
    - 'Male Voice: Try not hitting yourself will ya.'

      will be to find the missing 10 elements that aren''t showing up in the periodic
      table you see before you. There are many tools and hints that will help you
      in solving these tasks, once you correctly identify the elements using my-
      ahem, I mean our special machine, you bring it''s symbol to the periodic table.
      Bring them all and you''ll move on to the second room, we''ll touch on the
      second room when you get there. Since I feel sorry for you, we''ll guide you
      on this works.'
    - 'Female Voice: Let''s start with Identifying the element, Lithium. Start by
      walking to where the clue is right over there.'
    - 'Female Voice: Before we can properly identify the element using our clue,
      we must turn on the Bunsen burner first. Turn the wheel at the bottom until
      you see the Bunsen burner light up.'
    - 'Female Voice: Good! Now, carefully use the tong and grab the Lithium mineral,
      and place it over the fire.'
    - 'Female Voice: Great Job! The color of the flame matches the color of the clue
      we just saw! Now head on over to the Element Machine and let''s go get our
      symbol.'
    - 'Female Voice: Insert the mineral into the hole of the machine you see, and
      then correctly push the button that represents Lithium.'
    - 'Male Voice: Pressing the wrong button won''t do you any favors, you''ll thank
      me later on that.'
    - 'Female Voice: Excellent! Finally, you must put the Lithium Symbol in it''s
      proper place on the periodic table, and then you''re done! Use the clue as
      a guide for where it goes!'
    - 'Male Voice: Congrats! You found only just *one* element out of ten, and with
      time still ticking, who knows if you''ll even find the rest of them in time.'
    - 'Female Voice: Did you set the timer to go off as soon as our Pal walked in?!'
    - 'Male Voice: Maybe I did, Maybe I didn''t, who can know for sure. But that
      time''s running while they''re still standing. Hey Pal, we got you a freebie,
      you''re on your own for finding the rest of the elements, good luck beating
      this in time, if you can that is.'

      be ready for you to make immediately, it is as simple as it sounds. If you
